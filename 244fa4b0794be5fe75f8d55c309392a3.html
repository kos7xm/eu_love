Today, we speak the language of diplomacy, but in the past, it was possible to travel in a group and negotiate with anyone in any country, anytime. It was also possible to survive on a desert island and still be among the leaders of civilization. It was also possible to become a target of envy and hatred.It was also possible to become famous and successful.

The dream is not the same – it is more important to focus the energy we have.4. Don't stop trying. Even if you fail, don't give up. Don't be afraid – the world will not tolerate failure.5. Don't stop trying. Even if you are not successful in life, don't think that you are without a Plan B.6. There is no greater blessing than the ability to inspire.So, there you have it – the basic rules of a healthy lifestyle, which should be followed by anyone. .
